/**
 * LoadedDieSimulation.java
 * Takes as input an integer and simulates rolling a loaded die that many times
 * and reports the frequency and relative frequency of each face.
 *
 * The loaded die is biased such that rolling a 2, 3, 4, or 5 
 * is twice as likely as rolling a 1 or 6.
 *
 * Example: input 10000
 * Output:
 * Face Frequency Relative Frequency
 * 1    1005      0.1005
 * 2    1998      0.1998
 * 3    2010      0.2010
 * 4    1987      0.1987
 * 5    2003      0.2003
 * 6    997       0.0997
